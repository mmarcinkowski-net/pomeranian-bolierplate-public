          Pop culture used to define a generation, but it seems the cultural,
          music and fashion trends of the 1990s have been recycled, and what
          Generation X considered its rite of passage into adulthood, is being

          been the resurgence of vinyl as the trend-setters' choice of music
          consumption rather than the ease of a digital download, and now the
          hipsters have discovered the nostalgic sound of a whirring cassette
          from which to enjoy the dulcet tones of everyone from Salt-N-Pepa to
          Rick Astley.
